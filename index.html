    "Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.",
    "It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.",
    "The road to success and the road to failure are almost exactly the same.","Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.",
    "Opportunities don't happen. You create them.",
    "Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.",
    "I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.",
    "There are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world: those who are afraid to try and those who are afraid you will succeed.",
    "Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do. Don't wish it were easier; wish you were better.",

    "I owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice, and then going away and doing the exact opposite.",
    "Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It's quite simple, really: Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn't at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it, so go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember that's where you will find success.",

    "All progress takes place outside the comfort zone.",
    "People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",
    "Don't let the fear of losing be greater than the excitement of winning.",
